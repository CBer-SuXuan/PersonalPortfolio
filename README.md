# Minecraft Plugin Portfolio

This repository contains the plugins that I have made so far. Although they are small plugins, I think it can show my ability on plugin making!

## Personal description

Hello dear reader,
My name is SuXuan and I am 22 year old Minecraft Developer. SuXuan is my Chinese nickname I go by on the public Internet.

Through my career of two years as a java plugin developer for Minecraft, I have made various plugins. Even though I do have a couple years of coding behind me, every day is a new day for me where I can learn more things when it comes to plugin coding.

I did receive a lot of help from previous server owners and projects, where I used their feedbacks to improve my skills in java. I like coding and I want to become a full fledged java developer one day in future.

The plugins I code both as well in the past and present are made in my free time. Thus I am limited on how much free time I have to spend in regards coding a plugin and accepting a plugin request.

I offer my coding services for both free or paid services. I am not into plugin development for the money, so I don't mind if I get paid. Why? Because coding the plugins is a passion of mine. I enjoy creating a plugin that satisfy the server owner while also gaining more experience.

A positive side of mine being a plugin developer is that my ability to adapt and learn is on a high level. This means I learn quickly to incorporate and work with things that are new for me and my own expertise.

If you take a look at my portfolio and think I can create things that satisfies your thoughts, then I would love to create and work on a project for you. Feel free to contact me and I will see if I can help you out.

## Details are as followed:

### Small plugins:

- **BackPack**: Player can have their own pack to **store items**. And there are different tiers that player can have different slot amount.
- **ChangeServer**: BungeeCord plugin. It will allow players join in the specified server if other servers suddenly stop. Avoid making player rejoin the server.
- **CustomInfo**: BungeeCord plugin. Allow you to change **motd, max player, info in front of the server icon, hower info** to what you want, even it can use color on them!
- **HeartCraft**: A easy plugin for server. When you eat golden apple / enchant golden apple, it will **add max health**. Instead if you die, you will **lose max health**. I didn't add config for the plugin, because the man who want me to make this had already told me how many healths need to add/remove.
- **InvitationCode**: **My first plugin**. It will allow old players get their own invitation code and share with new players. If new player use this invitation code, they will both get reward. A Chinese Minecraft server owner provided the idea for me.
- **JoinReward**: You can **give items** to the player who is **new to the server** by this plugin. Easy to config and very useful for server.
- **LoginReward**: Not the same as JoinReward, you can **give items** to a **specified player** when he join the server(old player or new player). When a player is offline, you can set items that you want to give to him. When he **join the server, he will get the items that you set**. You can both use command or modify file to change each player items list.
- **LoginTeleport**: You can **edit the position when player join the server** using command. Simple lol.
- **RankAdvanced**: The characteristic of this plugin is that you can use three different ways to store data. Include yaml files, SQLite and MySQL. Because this is made for server, rank name is already known. Player can get points by using command. And if they get enought points, they will get a new rank.
- **RecordBlock**: This plugin **record the amount of every player break and place blocks**. It will record every 6 hours in different files.
- **RollBossBar**: You can make **custom bossbar** with this plugin.
- **Survey**: This plugin can **give players survey** when they kill enough players. You can modify questions and survey interval times. And the answer will save to the MySQL. By using this plugin, you can get players' thinking easily. If player quit the server when doing survey, they can continue the survey when they rejoin the game!

### Large plugins:

- **QuestsPlugin**: This plugin is for quests in server and it is highly customizable. You can customize different quests with its name, actions, rewards and so on. And the menu of categories and quests can also be customized! You can change button name, icon**(support HeadDatabase plugin!)**, lore, glowing in config.yml.
- **VillagerShop**: Still making. Stuff can make a shop easily and create trades of this shop by menu. Will extend more details in the future.
